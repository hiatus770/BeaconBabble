# Beacon
A simple JavaFX app designed to send messages over a LAN server.

# ! Currently, there is no executable JAR available. You will have to compile the code yourself if you want to use Beacon. !
## Usage
### Client side
To use the client side version of the app, you can either run client.jar in the client folder or compile the code yourself. Whatever floats your boat.
After opening the client, enter the IP and port of the server you want to connect to. Have fun!

### Server side
To run a server side version of the app, you'll have to compile on your own. We might create a neat jar file in the future, but the raw java code will have to do for now. When running, specify the port of the server through console arguments. Ctrl+C to shut down the server. 

This app is still in development, so new features will be rolled out frequently.
